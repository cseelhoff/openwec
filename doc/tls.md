# Configuration for TLS authentication

This feature is **EXPERIMENTAL**, please use carefully.

This documentation describes how to set up TLS authentication. Certificates need to be generated first, then follow the rest of the documentation in parallel with [getting_started.md](getting_started.md/#configuring-windows-machines).

## Certificates

**The following certificates are needed**:
- A certificate for the server, with extensions Server Authentication and PKIs,
- A certificate for the client, with extensions Client Authentication and PKIs,
- A certificate of the CA that signed the client certificate and the server certificate (they can be distinct).

**Requirements for the Windows client**:
- It needs to support TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 (this includes Windows servers from 2012 and Windows 8).

For older versions of Windows, TLS 1.2 needs to be available at least. At least one of the following cipher suites has to be available:
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

For more recent versions using TLS 1.3, at least one of the following cipher suites has to be available for it to be used:
- TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS13_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS13_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

You can find the currently available suites of a Windows machine in: *Local Group Policy Editor > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > SSL Configuration Settings* (cf. [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/cipher-suites-in-schannel) for more precisions).

**Requirements for the certificates and keys**:
- Certificate and key files must be in PEM format
- Server FQDN must be used as `CommonName` of server certificate
- `CommonName` of client certificate must be unique and should be distinguishable (they are used to display connections and as authenticated name in the logs)

Keys must be encoded using either RSA PKCS#1 (cf. RFC3447), PKCS#8 (cf. RFC5958) or Sec-1 (cf. RFC5915).

Only the following curves are supported:
- ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256 (also called prime256v1)
- ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384
<!-- - ed25519: this should work but can't import in windows ? / openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out private.pem -->

You can find the currently available elliptic curves of a Windows machine with the command: `certutil.exe –displayEccCurve`.

If the clients are only composed of recent Windows machines (more recent than Windows server 2012 R2 and Windows 8), [nxlog's scripts](https://gitlab.com/nxlog-public/contrib/-/tree/master/windows-event-forwarding) should work just fine for certificate generation, while modifying the subjects and making sure they follow the rules detailed before.

It seems that older versions (particularly Windows Server 2012 R2) tend to support only TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256. Certificates that are supported in this case can be created using the following (and largely inspired by the formely-mentioned) example script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Usage:  `script <ca-FQDN> <server-FQDN> <client-FQDN> [<curve>]`
# Don't forget to modify "O=example.local/C=HU/ST=state/L=location" with relevant values as well
# Curve can only be 'secp384r1' or 'secp256r1', by default it will be assumed as being 'secp384r1'

# by default, curve is secp384r1
if [[ -z "$4" || "$4" != "secp256r1" ]]
then CURVE="secp384r1"
else CURVE="secp256r1"
fi

# CA certificate

openssl req -x509 -nodes -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem -batch -subj "$SUBJ" -config gencert.cnf

openssl x509 -outform der -in server-cert.pem -out server-cert.crt
echo "###############################################################"
echo "Use the following for the Subscription Manager string:"
echo "Server=HTTPS://$SERVERNAME:5986/wsman/,Refresh=14400,IssuerCA=$ISSUERCA"

rm -f req.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -out client.pfx -inkey client-key.pem -in client-cert.pem -certfile ca-cert.pem
```

The content of `gencert.cnf` used for this script can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/nxlog-public/contrib/-/blob/master/windows-event-forwarding/gencert.cnf).

## Client configuration

Once all certificates are generated, the service can finally be setup. [Windows' manual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wec/setting-up-a-source-initiated-subscription#event-source-computer-configuration) is a good reference for this part of the configuration:

1. Install the client certificate on the Windows machine in the category `Personal` (from the certificate manager, right-click on a category and go to *All Tasks > Import...*, make sure to check the box next to "Include all extended properties")
2. Install the CA certificate (for the CA that signed the server certificate) in category `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`
3. Give `Network Service` the right to read the client certificate's private key (from the certificate manager, right-click on the client certificate and go to *Manage Private Keys*)
4. Modify local policy for event forwarding with the Subscription Manager string obtained when generating the certificates

Make sure to follow [the Getting Started page](getting_started.md/#configuring-windows-machines) as well for generic instructions.

If the client works on an older version of Windows, make sure to activate TLS 1.2 as explained [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2-client#bkmk_protocol).
(Some other references: [Enable TLS 1.1 and 1.2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-default-secure-protocols-in-winhttp-in-windows-c4bd73d2-31d7-761e-0178-11268bb10392) and [TLS/SSL Settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn786418(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)).

For troubleshooting, Windows Events from `Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin` (Operational) and `Windows Remote Management` (Analytics, needs to be enabled in the View drop-down) can be of great help.

## Server configuration

To configure OpenWEC on a machine named `wec.winserver.local`, the minimal options to configure in `/etc/openwec.conf.toml` are as follows:

```toml
# /etc/openwec.conf.toml
[[collectors]]
hostname = "wec.winserver.local"

[collectors.authentication]
type = "Tls"
ca_certificate = "/etc/ca-cert.pem"
server_certificate = "/etc/server-cert.pem"
server_private_key = "/etc/server-key.pem"
```
